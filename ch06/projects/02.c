/******************************************************************************

Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and
displays their greatest common divisor (GCD):

Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4

Hint: The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclidâ€™s algorithm,
goes as follows:

Let m and n be variables containing the two numbers.
If n is 0, then stop: m contains the GCD.
Otherwise, compute the remainder when m is divided by n.
Copy n into m and copy the remainder into n.
Repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.
